You need to download libspotify 9 for ARM to be able to compile and create the .deb package.
Get it there: http://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/overview/
Extract the content of the tarball inside 'libspotify'
at the root of the project.

The resulting hierarchy should be:
libspotify/
    include/
        libspotify/
            api.h
    lib/
        libspotify.so
        libspotify.so.9

You also need your own libpotify API key to be able to compile and run the program
(see https://developer.spotify.com/en/libspotify/application-key/)
Create a file spotify_key.h inside libQtSpotify and copy the provided key inside it
using the following format:

    #ifndef SPOTIFY_KEY_H
    #define SPOTIFY_KEY_H

    const uint8_t g_appkey[] = { 0x00, 0x00, ..., ... };
    const size_t g_appkey_size = sizeof(g_appkey);

    #endif // SPOTIFY_KEY_H

To compile the project, use the Qt SDK (version 1.1 or higher) with the Harmattan component
installed from the Qt SDK maintenance tool.
--> Open the project in Qt Creator, compile and deploy on the device!
